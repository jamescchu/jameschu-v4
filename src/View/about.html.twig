<p>
  Hey there! I’m James, and I love to design just about anything. However you’ll probably find me as a product designer more often than not, but I don’t like to limit myself just yet.
</p>
<p>
  Currently I’m constantly put through my paces at ArtCenter College of Design, and while the stress can be great at times, I never feel the slightest bit of doubt at what I love to do.
</p>
<p>
  There’s always something new for me to explore, new people to meet, and new experiences to be had.
