    <p>
      Major League Gaming was founded in 2002 as an eSports entertainment organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as it strives to become a household name around the world, it begins to fall short against it’s competitors. A new and more robust foundation must be built to reach for even greater heights.

    <h2>research</h2>
    <p>
      In order to create a new brand that is unique to MLG, I conducted a complete audit of the brand as it currently stands today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, it is paramount that MLG’s mission statement is preserved in order to guide this rebrand. Thus it is extracted as-is from their existing website.

      From the information gathered, it was determined that there was a lack of consistency in the overall brand and design, in addition to that, color fragmentation on the web is especially severe.

      Since it seems that Major League Gaming needs to hold up on two different fronts, I needed to analyze the competitor landscape separately.

      The current brand started to feel a bit dated, and did not reflect well on how far the company has grown in the years.

      By using a brand driver, I was able to pinpoint what MLG currently stands for by connecting it metaphorically to various objects. And with that same methodology, I have created a new vision for MLG based on their original mission statement.

      With a new direction in sight, it is now appropriate to begin the actual design process and ideation for the mark has started.

      At the same time, a new typographic style needed to be created as well. Various different styles and weights were explored, in order to ensure nothing was overlooked here either. It was identified from here that a modern sans-serif is what seems to be best suited for the job.

      Meanwhile the logo mark itself is also undergoing it’s last rounds of selection to determine the final direction. Variation 1 was eventually the direction chosen thanks to it’s better cohesion with the brand.

      Last but not least, to finally put the brand together, a color scheme is determined based off of real world interpretations of the brand. The old red and blue scheme is kept but modified to ensure the existing brand is not alienated. However, it is all under the wing of a new, more distinct color space from here on.

    <h2>applications</h2>
    <p>
      A brand is as much of a logo, as how it is incorporated into everything else around it.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

    <p>
      Business cards were one of the first to be created due to it’s simple yet representative nature of the brand. It really helped to experiment on the small and simple cards to figure out a direction to take everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is especially important that none of the applications of the brand in action just has the logo tacked on. Everything needed to be designed individually yet still be a cohesive whole. And this turned out to be quite the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once the design direction was decided, everything else seems to fall quickly into place and the rest is now history.
